5. Save the screenshots in this directory with the exact filenames listed above
6. Ensure screenshots are clear and legible (recommend PNG format, reasonable resolution)

## Image Guidelines

- Format: PNG (preferred) or JPEG
- Resolution: High enough to read text clearly (suggest at least 800px width)
- File size: Keep reasonable for documentation (under 500KB per image)
- Language: Capture screenshots in both English and Japanese if UI text differs
  - Use suffix `-en.png` for English screenshots
  - Use suffix `-ja.png` for Japanese screenshots
  - If UI is language-neutral, no suffix needed
